# I-before-E-except-after-C
"I before E, except after C" is a mnemonic rule of thumb for English spelling. If one is unsure whether a word is spelled with the sequence ei or ie, the rhyme suggests that the correct order is ie unless the preceding letter is c, in which case it is ei.

Using the word list from http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt, check if the two sub-clauses of the phrase are plausible individually:
  - "I before E when not preceded by C"
  - "E before I when preceded by C"

For example:

  - ie     believe, fierce, collie, die, friend
  - ei     after c in deceive, ceiling, receipt, ceilidh

The rule is very well known; Edward Carney calls it "this supreme, and for many people solitary, spelling rule".[1] However, the short form quoted above has many common exceptions; for example:

  - ie     after c: species, science, sufficient
  - ei     not preceded by c: seize, weird, vein, their, foreign, feisty, heist

If both sub-phrases are plausible then the original phrase can be said to be plausible.
Something is plausible if the number of words having the feature is more than two times the number of words having the opposite feature (where feature is 'ie' or 'ei' preceded or not by 'c' as appropriate).
